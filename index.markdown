title: Downunder Cons
---

These are a list of hacker cons and hacker meetups in the NZ and Aussie Area. If something is not listed please let me know, I can't be across all the hackers cons and hackers events in my head. My apologies if I have missed any. Email [cons]@[this domain]

This will only include cons and events:
* That have a public date (and is in the future).
* Where the primary focus is Hacking, InfoSec, etc.
* Online only cons where the focus and timezone is NZ and Aussie.
